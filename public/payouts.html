<!-- <p><strong>*Minimum Star Rating Policy:</strong>In order to obtain early payouts, developers must maintain an average star rating of 3.0 (three) stars AND must not receive any star ratings of 2 or less. If a user receives a star rating of 2 (two) or less stars, San Francisco Developer Exchange will review the situation on a case by case basis and reserves the right to issue a penalty up to and including suspension of early payouts and cancellation of membership - thus early payouts are not guaranteed and are dependent on each developer maintaining a minimum star rating.</p> -->
<p>*Payout begins on the first project after the payout minimum is earned. For example, if you complete a project with a total developer payout of $30,000 and then begin a second project with a total developer payout of $5,000, the early payout would be applied to the $5,000 project which is the first project after the project during which the payout minimum was earned.</p>
