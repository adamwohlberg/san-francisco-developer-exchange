<p>All clients and freelancers who formed their relationship on San Francisco Developer Exchange &trade; agree to keep their work on San Francisco Developer Exchange &trade; for at least 24 months. Clients can make payments off San Francisco Developer Exchange &trade; and directly to their freelancers only if the client pays an "Opt-Out Fee" for identifying the freelancer through the Site.</p>

<p>If the freelancer is hired for a full-time position by the client, the Opt-Out fee is calculated to be the greater of the following amounts:</p>

<p>$50,000 or,
50% of the value of the freelancer's annual salary.</p>

<p>$50,000 or,
The amount of all Service Fees that San Francisco Developer Exchange &trade; would earn or would have earned on all payments during the first 24 months, and in either case plus interest at the rate of 18% per annum or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is less, calculated from the date the client makes payment to the freelancer identified through the Site.
If you wish to Opt-Out of using the San Francisco Developer Exchange &trade; Payment Service, you must email San Francisco Developer Exchange &trade; at optoutfee@sanfranciscodeveloperexchange.com. In your email, please include the following information:</p>

<p>Your username.

Note, no protection plans are available for work paid off the San Francisco Developer Exchange &trade; platform.</p>

<p>4. Exclusive Agency. Exclusive Agency applies to all Members.  During their Membership term (as described in the section entitled "Duration" above), Member authorizes San Francisco Developer Exchange&trade; to accept a commission of no less than 20% of the total payment for all services provided to any member by any other member.  Member agrees to only accept payments from other Members via the Site and to inform Member of their Membership at time of offer. Any Member who attempts to bypass this Exclusive Agency provision by booking with a San Francisco Developer Exchange&trade; Member on their own without informing Member of their Membership at time of offer will have their Membership suspended by San Francisco Developer Exchange&trade; and will be personally liable to San Francisco Developer Exchange&trade; for any commission owed if San Francisco Developer Exchange&trade; is unable to obtain that commission from the Employer.  Employers who attempt to bypass this agreement will be liable for the greater of $50,000 or 50% of all payments made to the Developer for the Membership duration.</p>

<p>San Francisco Developer Exchange &trade; provides the most trusted marketplace for clients and freelance developers to meet, do great work together and pay/get paid.</p>

<p>Clients who identify freelancers via the San Francisco Developer Exchange &trade; platform are required to pay San Francisco Developer Exchange &trade; its Services Fees on all payments made to those freelancers for the first 24 months (Exclusivity Period) after identifying those freelancers. More details on this Exclusivity Period are outlined below.</p>

<p>These Service Fees are required, regardless of whether the client officially awards a job to the freelancer via San Francisco Developer Exchange &trade;.  For example, if a client identifies a freelancer via a job proposal but ultimately awards the job to another freelancer, cancels the job, or does not award the job, the client would not be allowed to hire the freelancer off the San Francisco Developer Exchange &trade; platform without submitting Service Fees to San Francisco Developer Exchange &trade;.
Should payments be made outside of San Francisco Developer Exchange &trade;, San Francisco Developer Exchange &trade; reserves the right to request the Service Fees for those payments.</p>

<p>After 24 months, San Francisco Developer Exchange &trade;'s Service Fees apply only if the payment is made through the San Francisco Developer Exchange &trade; site.
Members who attempt to take jobs and/or payments off the San Francisco Developer Exchange &trade; platform before the 24 months are subject to a $25,000 penalty to be paid by each member and including immediate termination from the San Francisco Developer Exchange &trade; platform unless the client has paid an opt-out fee for the freelancer. To illustrate, if Freelancer A and Client A send or receive payments through any means other than through the San Francisco Developer Exchange &trade; site, $25,000 would be paid to the San Francisco Developer Exchange &trade; by the freelancer and $25,000 by the client totalling $50,000 in fees paid to the San Francisco Developer Exchange &trade;.
Taking jobs or payments off the platform also leaves clients and freelancers more susceptible to fraud</p>
