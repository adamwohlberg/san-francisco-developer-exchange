<h3>Will I be charged if my <strong>request to hire</strong> isn't accepted by the developer?</h3>
<p>No. If your request is not accepted by the developer, or expires without a response, you will not be charged for the contract or San Francisco Developer Exchange&trade; service fees.</p>

<p>When you submit a request to hire, we'll place an authorization on your payment method for the total amount of the contract including any San Francisco Developer Exchange&trade; service fees. An authorization is a pending charge or hold on a payment, to ensure there’s enough money to cover the full cost of the contract.</p>

<p>Here's how an authorization works:</p>

<li>An authorization will usually appear in the pending section of your credit card or payment account.</li>
<li>If your request is accepted, the authorization will turn into a real charge and the amount will be deducted from your payment account.</li>
<li>If your request is declined or expires, we’ll automatically release the authorization and you won’t be charged</li>
<li>Depending on the processing time of your bank, the authorization release may take up to 7 business days</li>
<li>An authorization release will either appear as refund on your credit card or payment account, or alternatively, the original authorization may disappear from your account entirely</li>
