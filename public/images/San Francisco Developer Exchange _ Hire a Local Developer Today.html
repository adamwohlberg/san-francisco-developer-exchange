<p>b.      A free subscription to the San Francisco Developer Exchangeâ„¢ newsletter</p>

Memberships are not available to any Applicant suspended or removed from the system by San Francisco Developer Exchangeâ„¢ for any reason.  Members may not have more than one active account. Additionally, Members are prohibited from selling, trading, or otherwise transferring their account to another party. If you do not qualify, you may not submit a Membership Request.  San Francisco Developer Exchangeâ„¢ reserves the right to refuse membership to anyone for any reason.</p>

<p>2. Amendments or Modifications. These Terms and Conditions may be amended or modified at any time, without notice, on the understanding that such changes will not apply to Memberships granted prior to the amendment or modification.</p>
 
<p>3. Duration.  Membership begins when applicant makes a Request for Membership. A Request for Membership is reserved only for parties who have first taken note of the Terms and Conditions, and who have accepted the same by placing a mark in the box indicating that the Terms and Conditions have been read and accepted in their entirety.  The minimum duration of a Membership is 24 months.  Memberships do not expire and are valid until cancelled in writing by Member.  Premium Membership expires the day following the end of the minimum 24 month membership period following receipt by San Francisco Developer Exchangeâ„¢ of a written request to cancel Membership.</p>

<p>Opt-Out Fee</p>

<p>All clients and freelancers who formed their relationship on San Francisco Developer Exchange â„¢ agree to keep their work on San Francisco Developer Exchange â„¢ for at least 24 months. Clients can make payments off San Francisco Developer Exchange â„¢ and directly to their freelancers only if the client pays an "Opt-Out Fee" for identifying the freelancer through the Site.</p>

<p>If the freelancer is hired for a full-time position by the client, the Opt-Out fee is calculated to be the greater of the following amounts:</p>

<p>$50,000 or,
50% of the value of the freelancer's annual salary.</p>

<p>If the freelancer is not hired for a full-time position by the client, the Opt-Out fee is calculated to be the greater of the following amounts:</p>

<p>$50,000 or,
The amount of all Service Fees that San Francisco Developer Exchange â„¢ would earn or would have earned on all payments during the first 24 months, and in either case plus interest at the rate of 18% per annum or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is less, calculated from the date the client makes payment to the freelancer identified through the Site.
If you wish to Opt-Out of using the San Francisco Developer Exchange â„¢ Payment Service, you must email San Francisco Developer Exchange â„¢ at optoutfee@sanfranciscodeveloperexchange.com. In your email, please include the following information:</p>

<p>Your username.
The freelancer's username.
The job title.
After receiving your email, San Francisco Developer Exchange â„¢ will then post the Opt-Out fee as a charge to your account. After paying the fee you will receive a confirmation notice that authorizes you to make payments to your freelancer outside of San Francisco Developer Exchange â„¢. Note, no protection plans are available for work paid off the San Francisco Developer Exchange â„¢ platform.</p>

<p>4. Exclusive Agency. Exclusive Agency applies to all Members.  During their Membership term (as described in the section entitled "Duration" above), Member authorizes San Francisco Developer Exchangeâ„¢ to accept a commission of no less than 20% of the total payment for all services provided to any member by any other member.  Member agrees to only accept payments from other Members via the Site and to inform Member of their Membership at time of offer. Any Member who attempts to bypass this Exclusive Agency provision by providing services to a San Francisco Developer Exchangeâ„¢ Member on their own without informing Member of their Membership at time of offer will have their Membership suspended by San Francisco Developer Exchangeâ„¢ and will be personally liable to San Francisco Developer Exchangeâ„¢ for any commission owed if San Francisco Developer Exchangeâ„¢ is unable to obtain that commission from the Employer.  Employers who attempt to bypass this agreement will be liable for the greater of $50,000 or 50% of all payments made to the Developer for the Membership duration.</p>

<p>San Francisco Developer Exchange â„¢ provides the most trusted marketplace for clients and freelance developers to meet, do great work together and pay/get paid.</p>

<p>Clients who identify freelancers via the San Francisco Developer Exchange â„¢ platform are required to pay San Francisco Developer Exchange â„¢ its Services Fees on all payments made to those freelancers for the first 24 months (Exclusivity Period) after identifying those freelancers. More details on this Exclusivity Period are outlined below.</p>

<p>These Service Fees are required, regardless of whether the client officially awards a job to the freelancer via San Francisco Developer Exchange â„¢.  For example, if a client identifies a freelancer via a job proposal but ultimately awards the job to another freelancer, cancels the job, or does not award the job, the client would not be allowed to hire the freelancer off the San Francisco Developer Exchange â„¢ platform without submitting Service Fees to San Francisco Developer Exchange â„¢.
Should payments be made outside of San Francisco Developer Exchange â„¢, San Francisco Developer Exchange â„¢ reserves the right to request the Service Fees for those payments.</p>

<p>After 24 months, San Francisco Developer Exchange â„¢'s Service Fees apply only if the payment is made through the San Francisco Developer Exchange â„¢ site.
Members who attempt to take jobs and/or payments off the San Francisco Developer Exchange â„¢ platform before the 24 months are subject to a $25,000 penalty to be paid by each member and including immediate termination from the San Francisco Developer Exchange â„¢ platform unless the client has paid an opt-out fee for the freelancer. To illustrate, if Freelancer A and Client A send or receive payments through any means other than through the San Francisco Developer Exchange â„¢ site, $25,000 would be paid to the San Francisco Developer Exchange â„¢ by the freelancer and $25,000 by the client totalling $50,000 in fees paid to the San Francisco Developer Exchange â„¢.
Taking jobs or payments off the platform also leaves clients and freelancers more susceptible to fraud</p>

<p>Reporting Disintermediation</p>

<p>San Francisco Developer Exchange â„¢ members who wish to remain in good standing with San Francisco Developer Exchange â„¢ must report any Member who offers to conduct jobs or payments off the San Francisco Developer Exchange â„¢ platform in violation of the Period of Exclusivity. This violation is referred to as "disintermediation."  If you have any confusion about whether an offer is considered disintermediation, please contact San Francisco Developer Exchange â„¢ Customer Support. Members who engage in disintermediation are subject to penalty fees as outlined above.</p>

<p>5. Indemnification and Release. Except as otherwise set forth herein, Member hereby releases San Francisco Developer Exchangeâ„¢ from any and all liability, loss, expense, damages, or claims arising out of or resulting from their Membership, whether caused by the negligent, reckless, or intentional conduct of Member, San Francisco Developer Exchangeâ„¢, or otherwise.</p>

<p>Member hereby also agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless San Francisco Developer Exchangeâ„¢ from and against any and all damages, losses, claims, liabilities, deficiencies, costs, fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) and expenses, arising out of any claim brought against San Francisco Developer Exchangeâ„¢ regarding, resulting, or arising from their Membership, performance of these Terms and Conditions, or any violation by you of these Terms and Conditions.</p>

<p>6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</p>

<p>a.       DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</p>

<p>UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED, ALL GOODS AND SERVICES OFFERED BY San Francisco Developer Exchangeâ„¢ ARE PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN "AS IS," "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS.</p>

Applicable law in your jurisdiction may not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above exclusions may not apply to you.</p>  

<p>b.      LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</p>
