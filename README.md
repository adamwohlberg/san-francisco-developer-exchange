#This is the public repo for San Francisco Developer Exchange.

The SF Developer Exchange was envisioned to create a marketplace for developer contracts. 

Employers can search for local developers to hire on a contract, contract-to-hire, or full time basis.

Developers can search for local contracts and apply to them.  Developers can set a minimum contract amount.  Developers can be contacted through the app, but only by employers who have posted a contract that meets or exceeds the developer's minimum contract.

Employers can hire developers via Paypal and each is sent a notification email.

Both developers and employers can view their negotiations and their contracts.

The site has been live for about thirty days and is currently a 'ghost town', but please feel free to contribute any ideas.

Thanks!
Adam
